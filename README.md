## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, I was interestested in learning about traffic accidents in the UK from the year 2012 to 2014 with the traffic accdient data collected within those two years:

1. What time of the day do accidents happen more?
2. What kind of weather is most likely to lead to accidents?
3. How well can we predict an accident's severity? What factors correlate most to accidents' severity?
4. How well can we predict the number of casualties in an accident? What factors correlate most to accidents' casualties?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions, and markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

"accidents_2012_to_2014.csv" is the dataset I used for this project, but since the file is too big, it can not be uploaded to the repository. Please refer to link to the dataset in the *Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements* section. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@jonathan.cy.lim/how-safe-on-the-road-are-you-3526d9756?source=friends_link&sk=cd01e1fece50ad4e506577ccdcb1bcc8).
